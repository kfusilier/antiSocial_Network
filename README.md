★·.·´¯`·.·★ DESCRIPTION ★·.·´¯`·.·★

antiSocial is a MERN stack project created by the above authors while completing the General Assembly Software Engineering Bootcamp. The authors built this project with the aim of creating a social media platform that caters to introverts and their specific desires. Through team-designed market research, the data on an introvert-leaning platform emerged as focusing on front-end visual design and the offering of fewer but focused interactive user features:

-    Muted color palette
-    Simple and concise design
-    Extended privacy features
-    Text comment exchange between users
-    Ability to designate certain uers as friends
